# Trajectory Tracking using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project explores the advanced application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) to solve the complex problem of trajectory tracking in an omnidirectional robot. The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated control system that allows the robot to accurately follow a predefined path, both in simulation and eventually on physical hardware. The project bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications, aiming for high precision and adaptability in dynamic environments.

## Project Development

### 1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Control Systems**
   - **Algorithm Selection and Justification**: The project leverages the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, a synchronous variant of A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic), chosen for its balance between computational efficiency and learning performance.
     - **A2C** excels in environments with continuous action spaces and provides stable convergence due to its use of both policy and value functions. It effectively captures the robot's dynamic interactions with the environment, making it ideal for the control tasks required in this project.

### 2. **Design and Simulation of Omnidirectional Robot**
   - **Comprehensive Robot Design**: The omnidirectional robot was designed in Fusion 360, with an emphasis on creating a versatile structure that allows for movement in any direction. This design was crucial for enabling precise trajectory tracking, especially in environments with tight navigation requirements.
   - **URDF Conversion**: The detailed CAD model was converted into a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file, which accurately represents the robot's kinematics and dynamics. This format is essential for integrating the robot model with physics-based simulation environments like PyBullet.

### 3. **Custom Environment in PyBullet**
   - **Realistic Interaction Simulation**: A custom environment was developed in PyBullet to simulate the robot's interactions with its surroundings. This environment includes:
     - **Dynamic Obstacles**: Moving obstacles were introduced to challenge the robot’s trajectory tracking capabilities, testing its ability to adapt to changing conditions.
     - **Varied Terrains**: Different surfaces and inclines were simulated to assess the robot's performance in non-uniform environments.
     - **Sensor Input Simulation**: The environment simulates sensor data, such as LIDAR and IMU readings, providing the RL agent with the necessary inputs to make informed decisions about its movements.
   - **Task Definition**: The robot's task in this environment is to reach a target location while avoiding obstacles and minimizing deviations from the optimal path.

### 4. **Refinement of the Reward Function**
   - **Designing a Multifaceted Reward Structure**: The reward function was carefully crafted to guide the robot towards desired behaviors:
     - **Path Accuracy**: Rewards were assigned for staying close to the desired trajectory, with penalties for significant deviations.
     - **Energy Efficiency**: The reward function encourages energy-efficient movements by penalizing excessive power usage and rewarding smooth transitions.
     - **Time Optimization**: The robot is incentivized to complete the task quickly without compromising on accuracy, balancing speed with precision.
   - **Iterative Refinement Process**: The reward function was iteratively refined based on feedback from training sessions, incorporating adjustments to enhance learning stability and improve overall performance.

### 5. **Training and Performance Evaluation**
   - **Training Regimen with A2C**: The robot was trained using the A2C algorithm in the custom PyBullet environment. The training process involved:
     - **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Careful tuning of the exploration-exploitation trade-off to ensure that the robot efficiently learns from its environment while avoiding suboptimal strategies.
     - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Parameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and entropy regularization were fine-tuned to optimize performance.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Key performance indicators included:
     - **Target Proximity**: Monitoring how close the robot stayed to the desired trajectory.
     - **Trajectory Smoothness**: Evaluating the smoothness and fluidity of the robot’s path.
   - **Graphical Analysis**: Performance graphs were generated to illustrate the robot's learning curve, showing improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and task completion over time.

### 6. **Hardware Implementation (Ongoing)**
   - **Transition to Physical Implementation**: The project is progressing towards deploying the trained model on a physical omnidirectional robot. This phase focuses on overcoming challenges such as:
     - **Sensor Noise and Calibration**: Addressing the real-world imperfections of sensor data to ensure reliable performance.
     - **Hardware Variability**: Adapting the control algorithms to account for mechanical differences and variations in hardware performance.
     - **Real-Time Adaptability**: Ensuring the robot can adapt to dynamic environmental conditions, such as moving obstacles or changing terrains.
   - **Replication of Simulation Success**: The goal is to replicate the high performance seen in simulation, validating the A2C-based approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Results
   - **Simulation Success**: The robot has shown promising results in simulation, consistently following the desired trajectory with high precision. The A2C algorithm, combined with a carefully designed reward structure, has proven effective in achieving the project’s goals. Performance graphs reflect steady improvement in key metrics, including path accuracy and energy efficiency.
   - **Future Work and Feedback Integration**: As the project moves towards hardware implementation, ongoing feedback and experimental results will be crucial in refining the approach. Continuous improvements will focus on enhancing the robot’s adaptability to real-world conditions, optimizing the reward function further, and fine-tuning the A2C algorithm to meet the challenges posed by physical deployment.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to transition from simulation to hardware implementation, pushing the boundaries of Deep Reinforcement Learning in robotics!
